		<p>When I started to write this page I started with an example from class that had an "article" tag. But since the whole point was to understand semantic tags, I looked it up in the class reading assignments. According to what I read, the "article" tag isn't the best fit for this topic as a whole. That tag is for a chunk of info that's complete on it's own. Now, you could say an entire web page fits that description, but I believe the intent is that it's for a relatively <i>small</i> chunk of self-contained information. Let's say someone makes a blog post about how to use an article element... that post could be reused in a topic about someone's favorite tags. Here's an example of such content:</p>

		<article>The article element represents a component of a page that consists of a self-contained composition in a document, page, application, or site and that is intended to be independently distributable or reusable, e.g. in syndication. This could be a forum post, a magazine or newspaper article, a Web log entry, a user-submitted comment, an interactive widget or gadget, or any other independent item of content.</article>

		<p>When someone looks at the source code of this topic, they can see that the text in the previous paragraph is inside the &lt;article&gt; and &lt;/article&gt; tags. To be perfectly honest, I'm not sure how that helps. I'll have to keep looking.</p>

        <p>The new Figure tag let's you group an image along with a caption. Here's an example:</p>
		
		<figure>
